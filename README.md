# Are We Minecraft Yet?

Check if your server is vanilla Minecraft compliant or not.

For now, we require full vanilla compliance.

- [ ] Display the Minecraft version supported.
- [ ] Remove quirk requirement, to make example: Paper compliant.
- [ ] Minecraft servers that are a fork probably shouldnt be here
- [ ] Filtering by category's such as language support, finished (lol), etc.
